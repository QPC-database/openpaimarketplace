# Deploy Marketplace version v1.6.0 and later

> Note: This document suits for openpaimarketplace version v1.6.0 and later, and pai version v1.6.0 and later.

To deploy OpenPAI Marketplace, you need to prepare three parts when deploying Marketplace: database, rest server and webportal.

## Deployment in OpenPAI Installation

In OpenPAI v1.6.0 or later, admin can deploy the marketplace in OpenPAI installation step by setting `enable_marketplace: "true"` in [`config.yaml` file](https://openpai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/cluster-admin/installation-guide.html#prepare-configuration-files) under the `OpenPAI Customized Settings`.

### `config.yaml` example

``` yaml
user: forexample
password: forexample
docker_image_tag: v1.5.0

# Optional

#######################################################################
#                    OpenPAI Customized Settings                      #
#######################################################################
# enable_hived_scheduler: true
# enable_docker_cache: false
# docker_cache_storage_backend: "azure" # or "filesystem"
# docker_cache_azure_account_name: ""
# docker_cache_azure_account_key: ""
# docker_cache_azure_container_name: "dockerregistry"
# docker_cache_fs_mount_path: "/var/lib/registry"
# docker_cache_remote_url: "https://registry-1.docker.io"
# docker_cache_htpasswd: ""
enable_marketplace: "true"

# ...

```

Make sure the setting of `enable_marketplace` was `"true"` (include the quotation marks), and finish the [installation](https://openpai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/cluster-admin/installation-guide.html), the marketplace should be enable by default.

## Deployment in a OpenPAI cluster

When deploying in OpenPAI cluster, you should deploy 3 services: marketplace-db, marketplace-restserver and marketplace-webportal. The deployment process of these 3 services are the same as deploying other pai services (like webportal and rest-server). The documentation of how to deploy a PAI service is located in [this page](https://openpai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/cluster-admin/basic-management-operations.html#pai-service-management-and-paictl) and in `PAI Service Management and Paictl` section. Here we just figure out some main points about how to deploy these 3 marketplace services.

Firstly, start a dev-box and prepare a pai cluster config file **service-configuration.yaml** (please refer to pai doc how to get this file), and add some extra configurations in this file. Including: `cluster, marketplace-db, marketplace-restserver, marketplace-webportal` properties, the Advance settings step will give the details how to add these configs.

Then, push the new pai config file **service-configuration.yaml** to the cluster and start 3 services `marketplace-db marketplace-restserver marketplace-webportal`.

If the 3 services are started successfully, edit webportal plugin config in **service-configuration.yaml** file and push this file to cluster again and then restart pai webportal. Alternatively, if you are sure about the url of service marketplace-webportal, you could directly start OpenPAI webportal with webportal plugin config before the marketplace related services are started. When `marketplace-webportal` is started successfully, you could directly access marketplace plugin in the sidebar. Belowed are the detailed steps:

**Step 1.** Set `cluster.common.marketplace` to be true in **service-configuration.yaml**

  ```yaml
  cluster:
    common:
      marketplace: 'true'
  ```

**Step 2.** After the pai config file **service-configuration.yaml** are edited correctly, push config file to update the cluster config using command:

  ```bash
  ./paictl.py config push -p <config-folder> -m service
  ```

**Step 3.** Start marketplace services in OpenPAI:

  ```bash
  ./paictl.py service start -n marketplace-db marketplace-restserver marketplace-webportal
  ```

**Step 4.** Restart OpenPAI pylon and webportal service:

  ```bash
  ./paictl.py service stop -n pylon webportal
  ./paictl.py service start -n pylon webportal
  ```

## Advance settings

Set `cluster.common.marketplace: 'true'` will use the default settings in `marketplace-db marketplace-restserver marketplace-webportal`, and also add a default marketplace page to OpenPAI webportal.
But admin can still use customized settings.

### marketplace-db service settings

Admin can change marketplace-db settings in the OpenPAI config file **service-configuration.yaml**, all properties are optional:

```yaml
marketplace-db:
    user: <username>   # default is 'user'
    passwd: <password> # default is 'passwd'
    db: marketplace    # the db name
    port: 9291
    max-connection: 1000
    data-path: /mnt/marketplace # the data path of marketplace in master node
```

### marketplace-restserver service settings

Admin can change marketplace-restserver settings in the OpenPAI config file **service-configuration.yaml**, all properties are optional:

```yaml
marketplace-restserver:
    db_user: <username>     # use the value from marketplace-db settings by default
    db_password: <username> # use the value from marketplace-db settings by default
    db: marketplace         # use the value from marketplace-db settings by default
    db_host: postgres
    db_port: 9291           # use the value from marketplace-db settings by default
    server-port: 9292
    idp_url: <OpenPAI rest-server url> # use the value from pai rest-server settings by default

    azure_storage: # some feature of marketplace may use azure storage to allow user upload their data, no need this by default.
        type: blob
        storage_account: openpaimarketplace
        connection_strings: []
        azure_storage_json: ''
```

### marketplace-webportal service settings

Admin can change marketplace-webportal settings in the OpenPAI config file **service-configuration.yaml**, all properties are optional:

```yaml
marketplace-webportal:
    marketplace_api_uri: <marketplace_api_uri> # use the value from marketplace-restserver settings by default
    api-port: 9292
    server-port: 9293
```

### marketplace service settings

Admin can change marketplace related webportal settings in the OpenPAI config file **service-configuration.yaml**:
If don't want to use the default marketplace plugin in OpenPAI webportal, you can set `webportal.marketplace: false` and add to `webportal.plugins` manully.
If don't need the save-template feature in OpenPAI webportal, you can set `webportal.save-template: false`.

```yaml
webportal:
    marketplace: false
    save-template: true
    plugins:
    - id: my-marketplace
        title: my-marketplace
        uri: https://my-marketplace
```

## Notes

1. The marketplace will be deployed to master node in OpenPAI cluster.

2. User can still deploy marketplaces service without set `cluster.common.market: "true"`, but the OpenPAI cluster will not expose the marketplace uri without this config.
