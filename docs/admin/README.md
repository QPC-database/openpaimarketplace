# OpenPAI Marketplace Doc for Admins

In openpaimarketplace release v1.4.0 and later, the deployment has been integrated into OpenPAI cluster deployment process. This means the deployment of markeplace services follows the standard process of deployment of other OpenPAI services (like webportal and rest-server). Therefore, we recommend users to use openpaimarketplace version v1.4.0 and later, and correspondingly deploy it in OpenPAI cluster version v1.4.0 and later.
